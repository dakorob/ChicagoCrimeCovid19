Examination of Chicago Crime data with respect to Covid-19

This dataset showcases count totals for cases, arrests, and domestic cases reported through Chicago's CLEAR program available on Google's [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=chicago_crime&page=dataset&project=chicago-crime-investigation)

Having recently moved from Chicago to rural Illinois, I was particularly curious about this dataset.  I wanted to see how 2020 compared to other years in regards to crime numbers.  Additionally, I found it worthwhile to examine other facets of the dataset including overall trends of domestic crime in the city.  

The seasonal crime data is another amalgamation of case count totals extracted from the same dataset.  The window for this data is much smaller, a four year window, that I wanted to examine relative to the COVID-19 pandemic.

My slide-deck of insights is [available to view](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EkEKL4w-sio-vKzuiF7SLnXQOpgo1582otBITb4PNwU/edit?usp=sharing) if you're curious, but the trends are pretty robust here.
